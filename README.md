V0_4. Shadow Showdown for Foxton Center. Created in of_v0.9.8_osx_release 07.11.2017

Hardware
Kinect V2
An upgrade from the original Kinect meant we could target a better resolution, wider play area and higher framerate, helping create an overall better experience for players.

Screen
We wanted to translate a player’s silhouette proportionately on the screen while leaving room for the HUD. This ended up creating a square ratio screen with a height over 2 meters tall. Players can easily fit entirely on screen and with their friends while not being too close to the screen.

Tablet
Players can select, play and quit games without delay simply by touching the tablet located nearby. The layout of the tablet is similar to the main screen with both responding instantly to the user’s touch. Players can go from finishing a game to selecting another in seconds. The tablet is always connected to the game and vital for players who want to play game after game!
